# OpenAI Agents SDK

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides tools and frameworks for building sophisticated AI agents that can interact with the world through tools, memory, and planning capabilities.

## Overview

The OpenAI Agents SDK enables the creation of:
- Autonomous agents that can make decisions
- Multi-step reasoning systems
- Tool-using AI systems
- Memory-enhanced agents
- Collaborative AI systems

## Key Components

### Agent Fundamentals
- Agent creation and initialization
- Tool integration and management
- Memory systems and context management
- Planning and reasoning capabilities

### Advanced Features
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Context handoffs and delegation
- Guardrails and safety mechanisms
- Tracing and monitoring

### Integration Patterns
- MCP server integration
- Vector database integration
- External API connections
- Real-time communication

## Getting Started

The SDK provides several pathways to begin building agents:
1. Simple chat-based agents
2. Tool-augmented agents
3. Multi-agent systems
4. Long-running autonomous agents
