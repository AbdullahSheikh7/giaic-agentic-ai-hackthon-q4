# AI Protocols: Communication Standards for Agentic Systems

This section explores the various communication protocols foundational to building robust, scalable, and interoperable agentic AI systems.

## Overview

AI protocols form the backbone of agentic systems, enabling:
- Secure communication between agents
- Efficient data exchange
- Standardized tool and resource access
- Interoperability across different platforms

## Protocol Categories

1. **Foundation Protocols** - Core communication technologies like HTTP, REST, and JSON-RPC
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Standardized access to tools and data sources for LLMs
3. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol** - Direct communication between autonomous agents
4. **Content Declaration Protocols** - Standards like llms.txt for website-AI interactions

## Learning Path

We recommend following the protocols in this order to build a solid foundation:
1. Start with fundamental protocols (HTTP, REST)
2. Progress to specialized AI protocols (MCP)
3. Move to advanced collaboration protocols (A2A)
4. Explore content declaration standards (llms.txt)
