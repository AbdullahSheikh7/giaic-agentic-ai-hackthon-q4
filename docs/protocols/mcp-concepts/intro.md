# Foundational Communication Protocols

This section covers the underlying communication technologies that serve as the transport layer for more complex interactions in agentic AI systems.

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web and serves as a crucial transport layer for many AI agent interactions. Understanding HTTP is essential for designing efficient and reliable data exchange in distributed agent systems.

- **Purpose**: Standardized communication between clients and servers
- **Use in AI Systems**: API communication, tool access, data retrieval
- **Key Features**: Stateless, request-response model, extensible

## REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST architectural principles provide a framework for building scalable web services that AI agents can interact with reliably.

- **Purpose**: Architectural style for distributed systems
- **Use in AI Systems**: Defining standardized APIs for agent interactions
- **Key Features**: Statelessness, uniform interface, cacheability

## JSON-RPC (JSON Remote Procedure Call)

JSON-RPC offers a simple and efficient approach for inter-service communication that AI agents can utilize for function calling and tool access.

- **Purpose**: Remote procedure calls using JSON
- **Use in AI Systems**: Lightweight communication with tools and services
- **Key Features**: Simple, flexible, language-agnostic

## Streamable HTTP

Streaming data over HTTP enables AI agents to handle large datasets and real-time information more effectively.

- **Purpose**: Continuous data transfer over HTTP connections
- **Use in AI Systems**: Streaming responses, real-time updates, large data transfer
- **Key Features**: Efficient, real-time, memory-conscious
